# TextEditor

creator: Gorilla Ghost Enterprises

Version 0.1.0
Welcome to TextEditor an honest attempt at creating a text editor that can compete. Right now the program has basically no functionality but it looks okay. Never made a text editor before but once our team get cracking its sure to be a hit. As of now you can type out whatever you need in the text area and look at the shiny buttons. But look is all you can do....

Version 0.1.1
+Added an open feature
You can now go into a directory and open a text file. The text will display in the text area. Pretty cool right?
